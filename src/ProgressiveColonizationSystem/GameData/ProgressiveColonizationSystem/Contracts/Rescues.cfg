    name = RescueAtJool
    title = Rescue @/SpawnVessel/EscapePod/CREW/name from orbit of @/stuckAtBody and bring them to your base on @/goingToBody
    genericTitle = Space Adventurer Rescue
    contractGroup = SpaceAdventurers
    description = @/SpawnVessel/EscapePod/CREW/name really wants to become a colonist on @/goingToBody.  Granted, @/SpawnVessel/EscapePod/CREW/name might not have all the skills, abilities, disposition, temperment, and all-around intellect that the kerbals KSP chose have, but @/SpawnVessel/EscapePod/CREW/name makes up for it with sheer goforit.  However, somewhere around @/stuckAtBody things took a turn for the worse (read: ran out of lawn chairs and balloons) and...  well...  a little help?
    genericDescription = KSP goes through a highly selective vetting process for crewing stations, but sometimes kerbals feel like their amazing talents went unappreciated and set out for your colonies on their own.  Usually with mixed results.
    synopsis = We want you to rescue a kerbal
    completedMessage = @/SpawnVessel/EscapePod/CREW/name has joined your colony on @/goingToBody!
    prestige = Significant
